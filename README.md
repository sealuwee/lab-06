# lab-06

### The files for this lab can be found in the src/ folder.

### SortedArrayList.java 

- contains source code for the sortedarraylist class
- contains a constructor for a new SortedArrayList
- wasn't sure if we needed to explicitly do some kind of sorting algorithm to sort the array after any of methods would be called

### SortedLinkedList.java

- DISCLAIMER: I DON'T THINK I DID THIS CORRECTLY
- Was confused on how to sort the added nodes into the linkedlist
- followed a lot of the lecture examples
- couldn't get the add function to work properly

### SortedList.java

- contains code for the interface SortedList
- Interface uses the public methods from the SortedArrayList class

### Test.java

- contains test code for the requirements in this lab
